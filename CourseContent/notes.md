    -Requirements: Gathering and documenting the system requirements.
    -Design: Creating the architecture and detailed design of the system.
    -Development: Coding the software
    -Testing: Verifying and validating the software.
    -Deployment: Putting the software into production.
    -Maintenance: Fixing bugs and making improvements after deployment.

    Advantages:
    Clarity and Structure: The process is well-defined and easy to understand.
    Control: Facilitates quality control and project management.

    Disadvantages:
    Rigidity: Difficult to accommodate changes in requirements once the project has started.
    Late Discovery of Issues: Problems may be discovered late, during the testing or deployment phases.
